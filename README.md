# Project Description
This project is a web "business card" for a wrapping company, showcasing their services and contact information. The website is designed to be simple yet informative, providing potential clients with a clear understanding of the company's offerings.

### Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling the website and making it visually appealing.
PHP: For server-side processing, including:
- Sending the contact form submissions via email.
- Handling form validations on the server side.


### How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a local server environment set up (such as XAMPP or WAMP) to run PHP.
Place the project files in the server's root directory.
Open the website in your browser to explore its features.

The contact form on the website allows users to send messages directly to the company. This is implemented using PHP, which processes the form data and sends it to the specified email address.
